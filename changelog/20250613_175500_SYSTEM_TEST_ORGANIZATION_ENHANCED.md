## 🧪 **Test Organization by Type**

### **Unit Tests** (`tests/`)
- **Purpose**: Test individual service components in isolation
- **Location**: `tests/test_*_service.py`
- **Count**: 6 files, 56 comprehensive test cases
- **Execution**: `python -m pytest tests/test_*_service.py -v`

### **Integration Tests** (`tests/integration/`)
- **Purpose**: Test service interactions and end-to-end workflows
- **Files**:
  - `quick-test.py` - Quick functional validation suite
  - `functional-test.py` - Simple functional test scenarios
- **Execution**: `python tests/integration/quick-test.py`

### **Testing Tools** (`tests/tools/`)
- **Purpose**: Analysis and reporting utilities
- **Files**:
  - `test-coverage.py` - Test coverage analysis and reporting
- **Execution**: `python tests/tools/test-coverage.py`

### **Testing Documentation** (`docs/testing/`)
- **Purpose**: Comprehensive testing guides and procedures
- **Files**:
  - `Testing.md` - Complete testing strategy and scenarios
- **Usage**: Reference for testing procedures and scenarios

---

## ✅ **Verification Steps**

### **Verify New Structure**:
```bash
# Check directory structure
tree tests/ docs/testing/

# Verify unit tests still work
python -m pytest tests/test_order_service.py -v

# Run integration tests
python tests/integration/quick-test.py

# Run coverage analysis
python tests/tools/test-coverage.py

# Check documentation
cat docs/testing/Testing.md | head -20
```

### **Expected Results**:
- All files moved to appropriate locations
- Unit tests still execute successfully  
- Integration tests run from new location
- Testing tools function properly
- Documentation accessible in docs folder
