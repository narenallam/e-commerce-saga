## 📊 **What Was Enhanced**

### **Discovery: Services Were Already Well-Implemented!**

Upon investigation, I found that the **Payment**, **Shipping**, and **Notification** services were already very well implemented with:
- ✅ Complete business logic
- ✅ Comprehensive models  
- ✅ Full API endpoints
- ✅ Database integration
- ✅ Error handling

**However**, they were missing some consistency elements from the Order Service pattern, which I've now added.
