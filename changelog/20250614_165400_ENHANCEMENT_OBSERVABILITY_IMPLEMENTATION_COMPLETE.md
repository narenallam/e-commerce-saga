   - Service metrics visualization

3. Redis Exporter
   - Monitoring Redis metrics
   - Cache performance tracking
   - Client connections monitoring

4. Service Metrics
   - HTTP request rates
   - Response latencies
   - Error rates
   - System resource usage

## Dashboard Features
1. Service Health Overview
   - Request rates by service
   - Error rates by service

2. Service Performance
   - Response time percentiles
   - Request duration distribution

3. Redis Metrics
   - Connected clients
   - Memory usage
   - Command execution rate

4. System Resources
   - CPU usage by pod
   - Memory usage by pod

## Access Information
- Prometheus UI: http://localhost:9090
- Grafana UI: http://localhost:3000
  - Username: admin
  - Password: admin

## Known Issues
1. Kafka exporter is currently not functioning due to connectivity issues
2. Node exporter has permission issues in Docker Desktop environment

## Next Steps
1. Troubleshoot and fix Kafka exporter connectivity
2. Add more service-specific metrics
3. Set up alerting rules
4. Implement log aggregation

## Verification Steps
1. Access Grafana UI:
   ```sh
   kubectl port-forward svc/grafana 3000:80 -n monitoring
   ```

2. Access Prometheus UI:
   ```sh
   kubectl port-forward svc/prometheus-server 9090:80 -n monitoring
   ```

3. Verify metrics collection:
   - Check service endpoints in Prometheus targets
   - View dashboard panels in Grafana
   - Confirm Redis metrics are being collected

## Dependencies
- Prometheus Helm Chart
- Grafana Helm Chart
- Redis Exporter
- FastAPI Prometheus middleware

## Notes
- All services are configured with Prometheus middleware
- Metrics are scraped every 15 seconds
- Dashboard auto-refreshes every 10 seconds
- Persistent storage is enabled for all components
