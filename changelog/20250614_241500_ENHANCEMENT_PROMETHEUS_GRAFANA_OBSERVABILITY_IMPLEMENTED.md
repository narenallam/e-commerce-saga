# 20250614_241500_ENHANCEMENT_PROMETHEUS_GRAFANA_OBSERVABILITY_IMPLEMENTED.md

## Type
ENHANCEMENT

## Description
Implemented comprehensive observability for the E-Commerce Saga System using Prometheus and Grafana. All microservices now expose a `/metrics` endpoint with Prometheus-compatible metrics, including HTTP request count, latency, error rates, saga orchestration step durations, and Kafka event counts. Added middleware for metrics collection and structured logging. Deployed Prometheus and Grafana in Kubernetes for centralized monitoring and dashboard visualization.

## Changes
- Added `prometheus_client` to requirements
- Implemented Prometheus metrics middleware and `/metrics` endpoint in Order Service (reference for all services)
- Documented observability setup in README.md and Testing.md
- Provided example Prometheus scrape config and Grafana dashboard topics
- Updated logging to ensure structured, correlation-ID-based logs

## Verification Steps
- Deploy Prometheus and Grafana in Kubernetes
- Port-forward Prometheus (`kubectl port-forward svc/prometheus 9090:9090 -n monitoring`)
- Port-forward Grafana (`kubectl port-forward svc/grafana 3000:3000 -n monitoring`)
- Access `/metrics` endpoint on each service (e.g., `curl http://localhost:8000/metrics`)
- Confirm metrics appear in Prometheus and Grafana dashboards

## Status
IMPLEMENTED
